My background in design, knowledge of UI/UX, and my ability to quickly learn independently, and adapt to situations is working out for me in this line of work. My professional experience as a developer comes mainly from the internship periods, where I took part in brainstorming, pitching, and building a fullstack web application from scratch. Within this project, focus was on the frontend but also on UX/UI choices. During the other internship period, I was a consultant taking over a largely unmaintained code base with outdated dependencies, legacy code and bugs. My contribution to both projects was significant, and during both periods I showed that I can be capable, eager to learn and doesn’t shy away from challenges, and shows a delivery dependability.",
    "aboutmetxt3":"Professionally, I have experience with working in teams from working in large organizations, both as a leader and as a follower, and am comfortable with both roles. I like to take in all perspectives and make my coworkers feel valued, I feel that it is important to give and take feedback. As a freelancer, I’m used to working independently, to maintain deadlines and to plan projects. I’m responsive, and have experience with both dealing with clients, and being one. My experience with the web comes from working in a quick-paced editorial, among others, so I’m used to deadlines with curveballs and to quickly think on your feet. In an office environment you will most likely find me glued to my work, and you will find that I work quickly, energetically, and handle more than one task at a time.",
