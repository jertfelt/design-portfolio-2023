Before my arrival at the company there had not been anybody working with the frontend of the site since it was built by an agency two years prior and much of the initial work dealt with updating packages/dependencies and refactoring code, such as updating Node and replacing for example jQuery-code that interfered with React applications. After that I worked with a backlog of requested features as well as a total overhaul of the website's design and UI. The platform is built with React and utilizes Redux for state management.",

We operated in an agile environment, a kind of Kanban-Scrum hybrid, within a large team of over fourteen people. I was responsible for the frontend, which was built using the Angular framework—something I learned on the job without prior knowledge. Additionally, I worked on design systems and how end-users interacted with them. Simultaneously, I provided insights to the design department regarding improvements and the needs of existing components.",

I am seeking a workplace that is open-minded, transparent, and allows me to grow both independently and as part of a team.

I can handle many tasks at once, dislike working in silos, while also needing uninterrupted focus when thinking abstractly. I want to work in a team so that I can switch between pair programming, knowledge exchange, and coding independently. I am familiar with agile work, taking responsibility for delivery, and working with tests. With my background in design, I easily grasp UX and UI and constantly strive to improve both my work and others'. I don't put prestige in what I do but prefer a direct, open, and constructive dialogue, while maintaining high standards for my delivery. I enjoy bouncing ideas and code, want to be transparent, and have no problem asking for help when needed. The same goes for offering help!",

      "description1": "Bullying is a problem that affects the whole of society. It influences and permeates our coexistence. Bullying is happening right now, in schools, workplaces and other social contexts. Research shows that bullying stems from destructive group behaviours, that humans as social animals use bullying as a tool to obtain and retain power. Despite this, the image presented in the media is about the individual. In other words: it is the individual that is bullied and it is the individual that does the bullying, which in turn leads to an idea of bullying as an individual problem rather than a social one. This should be criticised, but it should also be changed! My project is about shifting the focus from the individual and towards formulating a movement and influencing opinion. It is about mobilising, inspiring, informing and, in the end, changing things. We can change. It is time. #Wecandobetter "

The municipality has plans on building housings on/in the forests there so that the inhabitants can be closer to nature, but at the same time only on their terms. It is a critical project, where the visitor is faced with what is human, nature, temporary and healthy.",

In the hunt for change and “improvement” an eye of the storm is born, where fine words such as sustainability, green structures and proximity to nature are used as decorations. At the same time we talk about natural value, what is more or less desirable? The language on the signs, as well as their rhythm and line breaks are taken directly from the communication of Uppsala. I have manipulated the word order so that the contrast between intention and result is made visible. The work is a portrait, a parody, and a testimony.",

With dry pastel paitnings, I have created a forest in the exhibition space. Then, as the visitor is listening to the sound piece, I subject the visitor to an exercise in mindfulness - which slowly and surely degenerates into a storm of emotions. The sound recording is a mixture of open source, my own singing, diary texts, practice matieral and sounds I picked up around Uppsala. I created approximately 50 trees of different sizes which, individually or together, with or without the sound work, have their own personality. In a way, the exhibition is therefore very personal, almost like an abstract self-portrait."
