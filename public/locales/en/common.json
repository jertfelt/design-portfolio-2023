Before my arrival at the company there had not been anybody working with the frontend of the site since it was built by an agency two years prior and much of the initial work dealt with updating packages/dependencies and refactoring code, such as updating Node and replacing for example jQuery-code that interfered with React applications. After that I worked with a backlog of requested features as well as a total overhaul of the website's design and UI. The platform is built with React and utilizes Redux for state management.",

My background in design, knowledge of UI/UX, and my ability to quickly learn independently, and adapt to situations is working out for me in this line of work. My professional experience as a developer comes mainly from the internship periods, where I took part in brainstorming, pitching, and building a fullstack web application from scratch. Within this project, focus was on the frontend but also on UX/UI choices. During the other internship period, I was a consultant taking over a largely unmaintained code base with outdated dependencies, legacy code and bugs. My contribution to both projects was significant, and during both periods I showed that I can be capable, eager to learn and doesn’t shy away from challenges, and shows a delivery dependability.",
    "aboutmetxt3":"Professionally, I have experience with working in teams from working in large organizations, both as a leader and as a follower, and am comfortable with both roles. I like to take in all perspectives and make my coworkers feel valued, I feel that it is important to give and take feedback. As a freelancer, I’m used to working independently, to maintain deadlines and to plan projects. I’m responsive, and have experience with both dealing with clients, and being one. My experience with the web comes from working in a quick-paced editorial, among others, so I’m used to deadlines with curveballs and to quickly think on your feet. In an office environment you will most likely find me glued to my work, and you will find that I work quickly, energetically, and handle more than one task at a time.",

Bullying is happening right now, in schools, workplaces and other social contexts. Research shows that bullying stems from destructive group behaviours, that humans as social animals use bullying as a tool to obtain and retain power. Despite this, the image presented in the media is about the individual. In other words: it is the individual that is bullied and it is the individual that does the bullying, which in turn leads to an idea of bullying as an individual problem rather than a social one. This should be criticised, but it should also be changed! My project is about shifting the focus from the individual and towards formulating a movement and influencing opinion. It is about mobilising, inspiring, informing and, in the end, changing things. We can change. It is time. #Wecandobetter "
